# Directus3D
Directus3D strives to be a simple yet powerful game engine. This is achieved by prioritizing a coherent design (including clean code) over anything else. While still in it's infancy and under heavy development, creating small scenes that require scripting, physics and so on, is possible.

The editor represtented in the above screeenshot is a standalone project developed on top of the engine, at some point it will also be included here.
