# Directus3D
Directus3D is a game engine that strives to be powerful yet simple. This is achieved by prioriziting a coherent and modern codebase design, a minimilistic 
approach when it comes to adding features and a state of the art editor. The editor is greatly inspired by Unity, it should make the engine feel familiar and pleasurable to use.
