# Code of Conduct  

Welcome to the **Spartan Engine Community**, a space dedicated to growth, collaboration, and innovation. This Code of Conduct is designed to create an atmosphere where everyone feels encouraged to contribute, learn, and thrive while maintaining the values that define this community.  

---

## **Core Principles**  

### **Free Speech and Respect**  
We believe in the power of dialogue and the exchange of ideas. Disagreeing with someone doesn’t mean you dislike or hate them. Constructive debates are welcome and encouraged, as they are essential for growth.  

### **Kindness and Logic**  
Engage with others in a way that is kind and logical. A good argument doesn’t need insults; it stands on its own merit.  

### **Self-Preservation of the Community**  
While free speech is vital, behaviors that threaten the health and survival of the community (e.g., hostile conduct, personal attacks) will not be tolerated.

## **Expected Behavior**  

1. **Engage Constructively**: Share your thoughts and opinions without hostility or malice.  
2. **Be Kind**: Treat others with respect and empathy, even if you strongly disagree.  
3. **Stay on Topic**: Keep discussions relevant to the community’s goals and focus areas.  
4. **Help Others**: Extend support, offer insights, and foster connections.  

---

## **Unacceptable Behavior**  

To preserve the community’s integrity, the following behaviors are not allowed:  

- Lying, spreading false information or misrepresenting facts.  
- Personal attacks, insults, or hostility (e.g., saying “F*** you” or worse).
- Refusal to engage in constructive dialogue when approached to resolve conflicts.  

---

## **Enforcement**  

We prioritize dialogue and open communication before taking action. If someone’s behavior becomes problematic:  

1. **Direct Discussion**: They will be addressed privately and honestly to resolve the issue.  
2. **Final Option – Ban**: If dialogue fails and the behavior continues to threaten the community’s health, a ban may be issued as a last resort.

## **Reporting Issues**  

If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:  
- Contact Panos (server admin) directly via Discord DM.  

All reports will be handled confidentially, with the goal of fostering understanding and resolution.

The Spartan Engine Community is built on the idea that we can all grow together. By adhering to this Code of Conduct, you’re contributing to an environment where ideas can flourish, connections can deepen, and individuals can evolve.
